## Project summary
A concise analysis of Flipkart's IT infrastructure readiness for Big Billion Days (BBD), focusing on monitoring, scalability, reliability, observability, and chaos engineering. Visualizations and diagrams are generated by the included Python scripts.

## Key focus areas
- Monitoring architecture and flow (Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Scalability and load handling (Kubernetes clusters, autoscaling)
- Reliability and fault-tolerance mechanisms
- Observability and tracing
- Chaos testing and resilience verification

## Repository layout

├── data.py              # data preparation
├── generate_all.py      # main script to produce outputs
├── monitoring.mmd       # mermaid diagram (monitoring architecture)
├── requirements.txt
└── output/

    └── tables/
```

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Generate outputs:
   ```bash
   python generate_all.py
   ```
   Outputs will be saved under `output/figures/` and `output/tables/`.

## Monitoring diagram
The Mermaid diagram describing the monitoring architecture is in `monitoring.mmd`. It models:
- Kubernetes clusters and services
- Prometheus federation and scraping
- Alertmanager routing
- Grafana dashboards
- Tracing with Jaeger
- Chaos testing workflows

You can render it using any Mermaid-compatible renderer (VS Code extension, mermaid-cli, GitHub rendering).

## Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Mermaid (architecture diagrams)
- Optional: Jupyter notebooks for exploration
